# ðŸš¨ Webhook Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Errors & Solutions

### 1. Schedule Tool Error: "no_available_users_found_error"

**What this means**: Cal.com can't find an available user for the event type.

**Solutions**:
1. **Verify Event Type ID**: 
   - Log into Cal.com dashboard
   - Go to Event Types
   - Find your consultation event
   - Check that the ID matches `1837761` (or update in Netlify env vars)

2. **Check Event Type Configuration**:
   - Ensure the event type is active/published
   - Verify it has available time slots
   - Check that it's assigned to at least one user
   - Ensure the user has availability for the requested time

3. **Test with Cal.com API directly**:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "https://api.cal.com/v2/event-types/1837761" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CAL_COM_API_KEY" \
     -H "cal-api-version: 2"
   ```

### 2. Email Tool Error: "Failed to obtain access token"

**What this means**: Azure credentials are missing or incorrect.

**Solutions**:

1. **Update ALL Azure Environment Variables in Netlify**:
   
   Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/cre8tiveai-elevenlabs-webhooks/settings/env
   
   Update these values (get from Azure Portal):
   - `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: Your Azure AD tenant ID
   - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: Your app registration client ID
   - `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your app registration client secret
   - `SENDER_UPN`: The email address to send from (e.g., stuart@cre8tive.ai)

2. **Verify Azure App Permissions**:
   - Go to Azure Portal â†’ App registrations
   - Find your app
   - Check API permissions include:
     - `Mail.Send`
     - `User.Read`
   - Ensure admin consent is granted

3. **Test Azure Auth**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://login.microsoftonline.com/YOUR_TENANT_ID/oauth2/v2.0/token" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
     -d "client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET&scope=https://graph.microsoft.com/.default&grant_type=client_credentials"
   ```
