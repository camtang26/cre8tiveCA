# Bridge Server Deployment Steps on Render.com

## Prerequisites
- Render.com account  
- Cal.com MCP Server deployed and URL available
- Outlook MCP Server deployed and URL available

## Step 1: Create New Web Service on Render

1. Log in to Render.com dashboard
2. Click "New +" â†’ "Web Service"
3. Choose "Deploy from a Git repository"
4. Connect your GitHub repository containing the cre8tiveCA project

## Step 2: Configure the Service

### Basic Settings:
- **Name**: `elevenlabs-bridge-server` (or your preferred name)
- **Environment**: **Python** (NOT Docker)
- **Region**: Choose closest to your users
- **Branch**: `main` (or your deployment branch)
- **Root Directory**: `bridge_server`

### Build & Deploy Settings:
- **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command**: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`

## Step 3: Set Environment Variables

Add the following environment variables in Render dashboard:

```
CAL_COM_MCP_SERVER_URL=https://your-cal-com-service.onrender.com/mcp
OUTLOOK_MCP_SERVER_URL=https://your-outlook-service.onrender.com/mcp
```

**Important**: Replace the URLs with your actual deployed MCP server URLs from previous deployments.

## Step 4: Select Instance Type

- For testing: **Free** instance
- For production: **Starter** or higher recommended for better performance

## Step 5: Deploy

1. Click "Create Web Service"
2. Render will automatically:
   - Install Python dependencies
   - Start the FastAPI application

## Step 6: Monitor Deployment

### Check Build Logs for:
```
Successfully installed fastapi uvicorn python-mcp httpx ...
Build successful ðŸŽ‰
```

### Check Service Logs for:
```
Bridge Server starting up...
Cal.com MCP Server URL: https://your-cal-com-service.onrender.com/mcp
Outlook MCP Server URL: https://your-outlook-service.onrender.com/mcp
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:10000
INFO: Your service is live ðŸŽ‰
```

## Step 7: Test Deployment

Once deployed, test the endpoints:

```bash
# Test root endpoint
curl https://your-bridge-server.onrender.com/
# Expected: {"message": "Bridge Server is running. Webhook endpoints at /webhook/cal/schedule_consultation and /webhook/outlook/send_email"}

# Test Cal.com webhook endpoint (with sample data)
curl -X POST https://your-bridge-server.onrender.com/webhook/cal/schedule_consultation \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "start_time_utc": "2025-12-10T14:00:00Z",
    "attendee_timezone": "America/New_York",
    "attendee_name": "Test User",
    "attendee_email": "test@example.com",
    "event_type_id": 1837761
  }'

# Test Outlook webhook endpoint (with sample data)
curl -X POST https://your-bridge-server.onrender.com/webhook/outlook/send_email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "recipient_email": "test@example.com",
    "email_subject": "Test Email",
    "email_body_html": "<p>This is a test email</p>",
    "save_to_sent_items": true
  }'
```

## Step 8: Configure ElevenLabs Webhooks

In your ElevenLabs agent configuration, set the webhook URLs:

- **Cal.com Scheduling**: `https://your-bridge-server.onrender.com/webhook/cal/schedule_consultation`
- **Outlook Email**: `https://your-bridge-server.onrender.com/webhook/outlook/send_email`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **MCP Server URLs not configured**:
   - Check environment variables are set correctly
   - Verify URLs include `/mcp` endpoint

2. **Connection to MCP servers fails**:
   - Ensure MCP servers are deployed and running
   - Check MCP server logs for errors
   - Verify network connectivity between services

3. **Webhook payload errors**:
   - Check ElevenLabs is sending correct payload format
   - Review bridge server logs for parsing errors

### Debugging Commands:

```bash
# View real-time logs
# In Render dashboard: Navigate to your service â†’ Logs

# Test MCP server connectivity from local machine
curl https://your-cal-com-service.onrender.com/health
curl https://your-outlook-service.onrender.com/health
```

## Full System Test

After all three services are deployed:

1. **Test Cal.com Integration**:
   - Send webhook to bridge server
   - Verify booking created in Cal.com
   - Check all service logs

2. **Test Outlook Integration**:
   - Send webhook to bridge server
   - Verify email sent via Outlook
   - Check all service logs

3. **Test ElevenLabs Integration**:
   - Configure ElevenLabs agent with webhook URLs
   - Trigger agent actions
   - Monitor all service logs

## Success Indicators

âœ… Bridge server shows as "Live" in Render dashboard
âœ… Root endpoint returns expected message
âœ… No startup errors in logs
âœ… MCP server URLs logged correctly at startup
âœ… Webhook endpoints respond to test requests
âœ… Full integration test passes with ElevenLabs

## Security Considerations

1. **Webhook Authentication**: Consider adding authentication tokens for webhook endpoints
2. **CORS**: Configure CORS if needed for your use case
3. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting for production use
4. **Error Handling**: Monitor and log all errors for debugging

## Next Steps

With all services deployed:
1. Document the deployment URLs
2. Set up monitoring/alerting
3. Test full end-to-end integration
4. Configure production settings if needed
