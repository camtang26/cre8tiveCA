# Quick Fix for 40+ Second Cold Start Delays

## The Problem
Render.com free tier services spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity, causing the first request to take 40+ seconds. This exceeds ElevenLabs' 20-second webhook timeout, causing "technical error" messages.

## Immediate Solution: Keep-Alive Endpoint

### Step 1: Add Ping Endpoint to Bridge Server

Add this to `bridge_server/main.py`:

```python
@app.get("/ping")
async def ping():
    """Keep-alive endpoint to prevent Render cold starts"""
    return {
        "status": "alive",
        "service": "bridge_server",
        "timestamp": datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()
    }
```

### Step 2: Deploy Updated Bridge Server

```bash
# Commit and push the change
git add bridge_server/main.py
git commit -m "Add ping endpoint to prevent cold starts"
git push origin main
```

Render will automatically deploy the update.

### Step 3: Set Up External Monitoring

Use one of these free services to ping your server every 10 minutes:

#### Option A: UptimeRobot (Recommended)
1. Sign up at https://uptimerobot.com (free tier includes 50 monitors)
2. Add new monitor:
   - Monitor Type: HTTP(s)
   - URL: `https://your-bridge-server.onrender.com/ping`
   - Monitoring Interval: 5 minutes
   - Alert contacts: Your email (optional)

#### Option B: Cron-job.org
1. Sign up at https://cron-job.org/en/ (free)
2. Create new cronjob:
   - URL: `https://your-bridge-server.onrender.com/ping`
   - Execution schedule: Every 10 minutes
   - Request method: GET

#### Option C: GitHub Actions (If using GitHub)
Create `.github/workflows/keep-alive.yml`:

```yaml
name: Keep Services Alive
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/10 * * * *'  # Every 10 minutes
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allow manual trigger

jobs:
  ping-services:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Ping Bridge Server
        run: |
          curl -f https://your-bridge-server.onrender.com/ping || echo "Bridge server ping failed"
          
      - name: Ping Cal.com MCP
        run: |
          curl -f https://cal-mcp.onrender.com/health || echo "Cal.com MCP ping failed"
          
      - name: Ping Outlook MCP
        run: |
          curl -f https://outlook-mcp-server.onrender.com/health || echo "Outlook MCP ping failed"
```

### Step 4: Verify It's Working

After setting up monitoring, test after 20 minutes:

```bash
# Check response time
time curl https://your-bridge-server.onrender.com/health
```

Should return in <1 second, not 40+ seconds.

## Alternative: Quick Upgrade to Paid Tier

If you need immediate reliability:

1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Select your Bridge Server service
3. Click "Upgrade" 
4. Choose "Starter" plan ($7/month)
5. Services stay active 24/7

## Expected Results

- **Before**: 40+ second delays → ElevenLabs timeouts
- **After**: <500ms response times → Smooth conversations

## Monitor Success

Check your logs for timing:
```bash
# In Render dashboard → Logs
# Look for webhook response times
# Should see consistent sub-second responses
```

## Next Steps

1. Apply same keep-alive to MCP servers if needed
2. Add response time logging to track improvements
3. Consider implementing caching for frequently used data

This fix should resolve the timeout issues within 15 minutes of implementation!
