# 🕐 Time Awareness Implementation for Stuart

## ✅ What I Just Deployed

I've created a lightning-fast edge function that gives Stuart complete awareness of the current date and time. This solves the problem where users had to specify the year and full date when booking consultations.

### New Endpoint Details

**URL**: `https://cre8tiveai-elevenlabs-webhooks.netlify.app/api/current-time`  
**Method**: GET  
**Response Time**: <800ms globally

### What It Returns

```json
{
  "current_time": {
    "utc": "2025-06-13T06:35:51.706Z",
    "utc_timestamp": 1749796551706,
    "timezone": "Australia/Brisbane",
    "local": "Friday, 13/06/2025, 04:35:51 pm",
    "year": 2025,
    "month": 6,
    "day": 13,
    "hour": 4,
    "minute": 35,
    "second": 51,
    "weekday": "Friday",
    "is_am": false,
    "day_period": "pm"
  },
  "relative_dates": {
    "today": {
      "date": "2025-06-13",
      "weekday": "Friday"
    },
    "tomorrow": {
      "date": "2025-06-14",
      "weekday": "Saturday"
    },
    "day_after_tomorrow": {
      "date": "2025-06-15",
      "weekday": "Sunday"
    },
    "next_week": {
      "date": "2025-06-20",
      "weekday": "Friday"
    }
  },
  "useful_info": {
    "current_date_string": "Friday, 13/06/2025",
    "current_time_string": "04:35 pm",
    "iso_date": "2025-06-13",
    "business_hours": {
      "is_business_hours": false,
      "next_business_day": "Monday"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔧 How to Add to ElevenLabs

### 1. Create the Tool in ElevenLabs

Add a new tool called `get_current_time` with these settings:

**Tool Configuration:**
- **Name**: `get_current_time`
- **Type**: Webhook
- **Method**: GET
- **URL**: `https://cre8tiveai-elevenlabs-webhooks.netlify.app/api/current-time`
- **Headers**: None required
- **Query Parameters**: 
  - `timezone` (optional) - defaults to "Australia/Brisbane"

### 2. Update System Prompt

I've already updated your system prompt to include instructions for using this tool. The key changes:

1. **Added get_current_time tool documentation** after convert_to_utc
2. **Updated scheduling workflow** to call get_current_time FIRST
3. **Enhanced instructions** to handle relative dates like "tomorrow" or "next week"

### 3. How Stuart Will Use It

Now when a user says something like:
- "Book me a consultation tomorrow at 2pm"
- "Is next Tuesday morning available?"
- "Can we schedule something for later today?"

Stuart will:
1. Call `get_current_time` to know today's date
2. Properly interpret the relative date
3. Continue with the normal booking flow

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Natural Conversations**: Users can say "tomorrow" instead of "June 14th, 2025"
2. **No More Confusion**: Stuart always knows the current date and year
3. **Timezone Aware**: Automatically handles timezone conversions
4. **Business Hours**: Knows when to suggest the next business day
5. **Ultra Fast**: <800ms response time globally

## 📊 Example Conversation Flow

**Before:**
```
User: "Book me a consultation tomorrow at 10am"
Stuart: *Books for random date in 2024* ❌
```

**After:**
```
User: "Book me a consultation tomorrow at 10am"
Stuart: *Calls get_current_time*
Stuart: "I'll check availability for Saturday, June 14th at 10am Brisbane time..."
Stuart: *Books correctly for 2025-06-14* ✅
```

## 🧪 Testing

Test the endpoint directly:
```bash
# Default (Brisbane time)
curl https://cre8tiveai-elevenlabs-webhooks.netlify.app/api/current-time

# With specific timezone
curl https://cre8tiveai-elevenlabs-webhooks.netlify.app/api/current-time?timezone=America/New_York
```

## 📝 Implementation Notes

- The edge function runs globally with zero cold starts
- Caches are disabled to ensure real-time accuracy
- Supports all IANA timezones
- Includes business hours logic for smarter scheduling suggestions
- The response provides multiple date formats for flexibility

## ✅ Next Steps

1. Add the `get_current_time` tool to your ElevenLabs agent
2. Test with phrases like "tomorrow", "next week", "this afternoon"
3. Enjoy natural, time-aware conversations!

Your agent will now handle scheduling like a human who actually knows what day it is! 🎉
