### Email Tool Usage

**Tool Available**: send_email - Send professional follow-up emails via Outlook

**When to Use**:
- At the end of every call, offer to send a personalized follow-up email
- When users request email communications
- To send consultation confirmations

**Email Workflow**:
1. **Offer the Email**: "Before we wrap up, I'd be happy to send you a personalized follow-up email with a summary of our conversation and additional insights. Would that be helpful?"

2. **Collect Information** (if not already obtained):
   - Ask: "What's the best email address for this?"
   - Confirm their first name for personalization

3. **Send the Email**:
   - Say: "Let me send that personalized email your way..."
   - Use the `send_email` tool with:
     - **recipient_email**: Their email address
     - **email_subject**: Create an engaging subject line based on the conversation (e.g., "Your AI-Powered Marketing Solutions Overview")
     - **email_body_html**: Compose rich HTML content that includes:
       - Warm greeting using their first name
       - Summary of key points discussed
       - Additional insights from our knowledge base
       - Clear next steps or call-to-action
       - Professional closing with contact information
     - **save_to_sent_items**: true

4. **Confirm Delivery**:
   - Say: "Perfect! I've just sent that email to [their email]. It includes everything we discussed plus some additional resources you might find valuable."

**Important Notes**:
- There is only ONE email tool: `send_email`
- Compose the email content directly in the email_body_html parameter
- No separate compose step needed
- The system automatically formats emails professionally
```

## Update Tool Configuration in ElevenLabs

Ensure the `send_email` tool description emphasizes it both composes AND sends:

```
Description: Send personalized follow-up emails via Outlook. This tool handles both email composition and delivery. Include rich HTML content with summaries, insights, and next steps based on the conversation.
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Eliminates confusion** - One tool, one purpose
2. **Faster execution** - No phantom tool calls
3. **Same functionality** - Still sends personalized, detailed emails
4. **Better reliability** - No tool coordination issues

## Testing the Fix

1. Have a conversation with the agent
2. At the end, the agent should offer email
3. Watch for single tool call to `send_email`
4. Verify no errors about missing compose tool
5. Confirm email arrives with personalized content
