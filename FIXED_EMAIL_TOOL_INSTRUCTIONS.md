## Update Tool Configuration in ElevenLabs

Ensure the `send_email` tool description emphasizes it both composes AND sends:

```
Description: Send personalized follow-up emails via Outlook. This tool handles both email composition and delivery. Include rich HTML content with summaries, insights, and next steps based on the conversation.
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Eliminates confusion** - One tool, one purpose
2. **Faster execution** - No phantom tool calls
3. **Same functionality** - Still sends personalized, detailed emails
4. **Better reliability** - No tool coordination issues

## Testing the Fix

1. Have a conversation with the agent
2. At the end, the agent should offer email
3. Watch for single tool call to `send_email`
4. Verify no errors about missing compose tool
5. Confirm email arrives with personalized content
